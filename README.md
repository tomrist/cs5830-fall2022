### Syllabus for CS 5830

# Syllabus for CS 5830

Welcome to CS 5830, Cryptography. We will be studying cryptography, both the
theory and how it is used in practice. By the end of the course you should
understand the basics of cryptography, how cryptographers analyze the
security of cryptographic schemes, and how to implement suitable
cryptographic algorithms within broader projects. 

Classroom: Bloomberg Center 131

Lecture time: 4:20pm-5:35pm Monday/Wednesday

Instructor: Tom Ristenpart (https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

Office hours: TBA

TAs: Andres Fabrega (af535@cornell.edu), Dhrumilkumar Patel (djp265@cornell.edu),  Sanketh Menda (sm2289@cornell.edu)

TA Office hours: TBA. You may also join the #office-hours channel on Slack for virtual OH and expect TA response in a day or two.

You will be invited to a class slack, which we will use for announcements, Q&A,
etc.  Contact the TAs if you are having trouble getting onto it.

### Pre-requisites

Students should have programming experience (we will be focusing on Python),
understand basic probability, know binary representations (ASCII), operations on
bit strings (XOR), have some background on computer networking, file systems,
etc.  Equivalent of CS2800 (Discrete Mathematics) and comfort with reasoning
about algorithms, such as proving their correctness and analyzing their running
times, or permission of instructor.  

### Requirements

The class will involve lectures and a number of homework assignments, which will be a combination of implementation and 
short written answers. You'll be graded according to the following:

* Participation: 10%
* Homeworks:  90% (each homework will count an equal amount)

**Late Days.** Homeworks are due on the due date by 11:59:59pm EST. You can
use in total 3 late days throughout the semester.

There will be several opportunities for extra credit on homeworks, as well. The current plan
is to have five homework assignments spread across the semester. Details and
schedule will be released in the first week of class. 


### Background reading and Lecture note

The following books should be helpful, but none are required if you don't want to spend the money:


* [Cryptography 101 by Houtven](https://www.crypto101.io/). Free, but not complete. Feel free to send helpful feedback to the author.

* [Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno](https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography_engineering/). A gentle
  introduction to cryptography.

* [Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html). A formal treatment of cryptography.
  We will make reference to, but not go into detail on, topics they treat in
  more detail.


## Lecture schedule

The lecture schedule is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v-MSDAl-SilmcWJFR_IDmek4y0nO36y-p1bWyS3LCS4/edit?usp=sharing).
Lectures will be mostly in person, though possibly with some remotely delivered (Zoom, check Canvas or Slack for the link). 
Students are encouraged to attend in-person when lecture is in-person, but the lectures should be available remotely.
